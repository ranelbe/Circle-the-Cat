# Circle the Cat
Puzzle game in which the goal is to trap the cat inside the board. <br>
But it's not so easy - the cat is smart and knows at any time what is the shortest path to the board's edges, using <b>BFS algorithm</b>. <br>
Strong emphasis on implementing object oriented design principles. <br>
Written in C++ using the SFML library. <br>
Made by @idanc7596 and me.
